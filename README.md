matplotlib and seaborn to get nice plots and sci-kit learn to get models we want to train.

## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

As practice for myself i decided to take a look on the Seattle AirBnB Dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle).<br>
To get an overview of the Data i wanted to practice the CRISP-DM Process to analyze, filter and train a model which should be able to predict prices to a given date.
The Data Itself contains the prices stored over a year.
